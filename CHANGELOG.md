# Changelog

## 0.0.2

- Fixed `scaffold` command so that it uses the correct platform separator.  Instead of creating files in the CWD, it creates them in $name/lib and $name/test of the CWD.

## 0.0.1

- Added `scaffold` command, which generates all of the files need for a component.  This should be run from an empty folder and provider a selector name like `my-foo-bar`.
